1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
I don't know how you actually feel.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,600
I just want to do something nice for them.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,800
<i>I'm sorry for being</i>
<i>such a terrible leader,</i>

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,320
<i>while, in fact,</i>

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
<i>none of them wants to work</i>
<i>under MARS anymore.</i>

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
It seems someone is still going back
to the group's house.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,360
Thame, it's your turn now.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,640
<i>Can you help reunite us as a group?</i>

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,600
Whether you can or can't, give me a sign.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,560
{\an8}MR. A, YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.
YOU WENT TO SEE MR. B, RIGHT?

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,920
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT ONLY ONE CHANCE
TO TELL THE TRUTH! @PAWAT.1ANAN

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,320
{\an8}YOUR SCHEDULE TODAY IS FULL OF "MR. B"

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,880
{\an8}I GOT IT NOW HOW IMPORTANT MR. B IS TO YOU

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
You talked about my story
at the alumni gathering?

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
Gotcha.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,240
Does this mean
you're now admitting it's your story?

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm talking about what I told you,
not my story.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,280
Well, our friends asked
why you didn't show up,

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,200
so I made something up
to keep you looking good, you know.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Ugh, you're just…

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,120
So, why didn't you show up,

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,160
even after promising me so seriously?

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,120
Tell me.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,160
Work… came up unexpectedly.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,400
Let me help

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,080
sew the fabric.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
Hey, it's all right.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,200
I think you need to clear
things up with a few people.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
They must be shocked

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
since you've never acted this way before.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Let me help you.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,120
Then, just leave the needle threaded.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
I'll baste the fabric
for Uncle Joei myself.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,320
You know how to do it, right?

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,320
I guess I do.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Are you in a hurry to go somewhere?

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
It's okay if you have something to do.

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,000
Well,

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
since Uncle Joei left the shop like this,

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,480
it's probably going to be a while

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,080
But…

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,400
if I delay your work,

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
and if it's finished really late,

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
let me send you home.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,280
It's a delicate job, isn't it?

46
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,040
You're being very careful.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,840
I have to.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,880
It's a detailed job.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,120
The sandwich tastes good.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
If you drop by the shop next time,

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,040
can you buy one for me too?

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,160
Sure,

53
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,640
if there's a chance.

54
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,120
Did work come up or a guy, seriously?

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Work, of course.

56
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,120
Tae, fetch Mick.

57
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
There's definitely trouble!

58
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
What the hell is damn
wrong with you, Thame?!

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,080
Hey!

60
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,480
Jun, what are you doing?

61
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
- What's with you?
- Dylan!

62
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,200
- Stop it!
- Stop, all of you!

63
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,360
What is so damn wrong with you?

64
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,640
We could have ended this nicely.

65
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,440
What's wrong with you? Huh?

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,400
Us?!

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,440
- Dylan!
- Us?!

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,720
- Dylan.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

69
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Stop fighting already!

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,240
Relax.

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,160
What's wrong with you guys?

72
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,440
Thame, get up.

73
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,880
You all just keep causing problems!

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Go. Head to the practice room now.

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Ming, Tae, take them there.

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Stop doing something insane
and head back to Korea already.

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Dylan.

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Thame, Miss Pemika asked for you.

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
Come.

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
Do you know

81
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
how much damage
you've caused by not going there?

82
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,320
It's just language training.

83
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
I can do it here.

84
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,920
Explain to that team for me,

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,520
telling them I want to stay here
and practice for the concert.

86
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,680
Give me some time.

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,960
I know what you're trying to do,

88
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,040
but it's going in vain.

89
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,800
Fine. If you need time,
I can give you that,

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,040
but you're not allowed
to practice with the other members.

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Huh? But…

92
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,320
Use the time I've given you

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
to think carefully
about what's best for you.

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,160
In the meantime, unless called,
don't come to the company.

95
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,160
Mick,

96
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,840
have someone drive Thame home.

97
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,280
Then, issue the company's statement,

98
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
saying that Thame is sick
and needs treatment.

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,480
All his scheduled jobs
are canceled indefinitely.

100
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
You can leave now.

101
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Thank you.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,920
Mick asked me to drive you home.

103
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
He said the traffic
is terrible at this hour.

104
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,559
He doesn't like getting stuck
on the road for too long.

105
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,799
It's a waste of his time for work.

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,920
MAP
SEARCH DESTINATION

107
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, where should we go?

108
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm sorry for making things complicated.

109
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
You're in trouble

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
because of me, right?

111
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
You? No.

112
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,440
It's all because of me.

113
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
It's I…

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
who put you in trouble.

115
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah?

116
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,600
I think Thame isn't someone
who would plan and do something alone.

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,120
I believe someone
must have been instigating this.

118
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,480
Do you want me to find out who?

119
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,360
You're offering to help like this,
so what do you want from us?

120
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
I just want the company

121
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,720
to pretend to forget
our group's remaining 2-year contract

122
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,360
and allow me to sign with that company,

123
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,960
so I can finally start my acting career
that I've always wanted to do.

124
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,680
Deal? It's a win-win situation.

125
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,160
Actually, it won't benefit me at all

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
from finding out who that person is.

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,760
But what I want
is Thame agreeing to go to Korea.

128
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,960
But I think

129
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,640
if you can find out who that idiot is,

130
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,680
it will be easier to bring
Thame to Korea, won't it?

131
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,480
Get ready to fire that idiot.

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
That's how scary Jun is.

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,960
I won't mess with him for now.

134
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,560
How about convincing
the other members to join us first?

135
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,840
It's probably easier
to pressure Jun that way.

136
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,000
No.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,720
Jun must be the first one, no matter what.

138
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,080
But you've just mentioned that…

139
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,280
To make this plan successful,

140
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,560
Jun must really be the first one.

141
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Jun, it took you forever!
Hurry up and get to shooting.

142
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
The director is waiting.

143
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,320
Hurry up.

144
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,160
- You need to get your makeup done quickly.
- It's because Jun is someone

145
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,320
I believe in and trust.

146
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,400
- Bro, hello.
- Yeah.

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,760
- You've just arrived?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Don't you think this location is too hot?

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,160
I told you to be here at 6 a.m.
Why did you show up at nine?

150
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,560
Eh?

151
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,400
Didn't you say nine?

152
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
See?

153
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,960
Six and nine look alike.

154
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,640
Since I came at the wrong time,

155
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
if the client complains,
who will take responsibility?

156
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,640
Hey, whose snack is that?

157
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
Can I take it?

158
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,560
- That one?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,160
Can you make
the products more visible, please?

160
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,960
- Sure.
- Okay. Thank you.

161
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
I bought it for you, Gam.

162
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,160
Thanks a lot,
but next time, you don't have to.

163
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,320
Don't trouble yourself.

164
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm sorry I came late.

165
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,240
I woke up early to queue up for this,

166
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,040
but tons of people were there.

167
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,880
It's really delicious.
I want you to try it.

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,160
Let me take some photos.

169
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
Sure.

170
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,560
Don't you want some photos with me, too?

171
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
All right.
I'll ask someone to take them for us.

172
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry. I'll do it.

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,600
But he's the one
who punched you and knocked you down.

174
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
That's him.

175
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,400
To be honest,
I don't understand anything at all.

176
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's put it this way.

177
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,760
I'll figure out a way to talk to him.

178
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
How will you do that?

179
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,760
I have my own way.

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,120
But you'd better stay away from me now

181
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,600
because if he suspects anyone,
it will be you.

182
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,240
If something urgent is up,

183
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,920
call me.

184
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
You can't outrun the power of the law!

185
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,080
Cut!

186
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,560
Wow, bro.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
You nailed it.

188
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
Did it hurt?

189
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,240
I'm fine.

190
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
No big deal.

191
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,760
Did you record it?

192
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,200
I didn't.

193
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,240
Show me.

194
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,520
I really didn't record anything.

195
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,760
What kind of documentary director are you?

196
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Why aren't you capturing every moment?

197
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,600
So, you want me to film you or not?

198
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
Show me, then.

199
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm curious what you've shot.

200
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,120
But what I want to watch the most

201
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,000
is the footage of Thame the other day.

202
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,840
Perhaps

203
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,080
you're the one who sparked this mess.

204
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,480
Where's that clip?

205
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
Gotcha.

206
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,240
You're acting suspicious.

207
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,680
I'm not.

208
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,600
If you scroll through it yourself,
how can you find it?

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,680
Let me do that for you.

210
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,680
Oh, really?

211
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,480
You interviewed him, didn't you?
How was it?

212
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,640
Did he say anything?

213
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,200
Especially if it's the clip
where he vented his feelings,

214
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,080
I'm sure that's what instigated
this conflict.

215
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,720
Play the clip.

216
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,040
A food support truck is here for you, Jun.

217
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,840
Wow, Jun.

218
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Your fans are going all out today.

219
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,920
They're not his fans, but…

220
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,840
Enjoy the food.

221
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,800
FRIED CHICKEN
FRIED WITH CARE, A TREAT TO SHARE

222
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,080
- Thank you. Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Thank you.

224
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
Thank you.

225
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,160
Jun! Jun! Jun. We're in trouble now.

226
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,920
Thame didn't stay home.

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,040
He refused to pretend to be sick
as the company's statement claimed.

228
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
He came to see you here.

229
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,520
What should we do?

230
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,280
Eh? Isn't it your job to handle that?

231
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,800
Can't you see what I'm doing?

232
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,359
True.

233
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,839
Don't interrupt Jun now

234
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,280
because I think
he can't handle Thame either.

235
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,359
You said who can't handle Thame again?

236
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,000
You, Jun.

237
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
You can't handle him.

238
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,720
If you could,
then you must have done it already.

239
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
I thought you were sick, Thame.

240
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,120
- Actually, I'm recovered now.
- He's still sick,

241
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,320
but I think he pushed himself to come out.

242
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,120
If there are no more questions,
please let Thame rest.

243
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,120
But I pushed myself to come out
because I wanted to see Jun.

244
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,040
Oh my gosh!

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,920
Can you say something, Thame?

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I brought Jun the food support truck here

247
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,280
because I didn't have time
to congratulate Jun

248
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,120
both on his movie

249
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
and our upcoming album.

250
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,760
Upcoming album?

251
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,760
MARS is starting our next chapter,

252
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
- and now, we're…
- Come on, Thame.

253
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
Don't give away too many spoilers, okay?

254
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,840
- It seems they want some spoilers.
- Hey.

255
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,040
Do you want to hear them?

256
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Please. Please go ahead.

257
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,720
MARS is definitely coming back soon.

258
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,880
We'll bring the song that…

259
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,120
Something just bit me.

260
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm allergic to insects.

261
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,760
Do you have any medicine?

262
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,520
Or… can we pause the interview here?

263
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,280
We don't need to do that

264
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,520
because when I was sick,

265
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,960
I had allergies, too.

266
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,960
My symptoms were similar
to what Jun is experiencing now.

267
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,120
That's why I brought him
anti-allergy cream today.

268
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
That's such a sweet moment!

269
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,600
Actually, I knew Jun was sick.

270
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,000
That's why I brought this for him.

271
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,560
I know it's going to be tough on set,

272
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,600
and I'm not sure
what the location is like either.

273
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,080
But no matter where the location is, see?

274
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,000
Thame is always ready to support me
as an "actor".

275
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,480
Otherwise, he wouldn't bring me
both the food support truck

276
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,400
and the medicine.

277
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,280
This is my true friend,

278
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,480
someone who's always ready to support me
on the path I've already chosen.

279
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,040
And I've chosen the acting career.

280
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,560
I'll definitely become Jun,
Secret Agent 005,

281
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
not just Jun from MARS,

282
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,560
- but about our upcoming album.
- Whether we have an album or not,

283
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
I'll always be the same Jun,

284
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
who's not attached to any name.

285
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
And this is our friendship.

286
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,080
Feed each other fried chicken, please.

287
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Sure.

288
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,040
Yum, yum, Thame.

289
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,040
Eat up. Yum, yum. Yum, yum.

290
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
That's so adorable.

291
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,800
Well, if there are no more questions,
please let Thame rest for now.

292
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Mick, please take care of Thame for me.

293
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,520
Hurry up and get him out of here.

294
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,160
I need to handle that thing next.

295
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,160
You're here to interview me, aren't you?

296
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,840
Why are you sitting here?

297
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm thinking about the questions.

298
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
So, what do you want to ask?

299
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,600
Well…

300
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,080
Let me see what you interviewed Thame.

301
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm not done suspecting you.

302
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,840
You saw

303
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,920
how I had the upper hand over him, right?

304
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,000
<i>To make sure we won't get caught,</i>

305
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,080
you should move the clip
where I told the truth to another file

306
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,320
because I think someone
like him will definitely check.

307
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,000
Got it.

308
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,600
Do we need to finish the whole script?

309
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
Here?

310
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
I don't think it'll work.

311
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
We might end up getting caught

312
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
because we haven't returned
to the group's house at all.

313
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,200
I think you should cut the ending
where you inserted the interview

314
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,520
and just show him the beginning.

315
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,160
He's a hot-tempered person,

316
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,480
so if he only sees that part
and feels embarrassed,

317
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,120
he'll stop watching.

318
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,960
<i>Finally, Jun, your acting career…</i>

319
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,960
Be honest with me.

320
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
Why are you so suspicious of me?

321
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm just here to earn money.

322
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
You're the most suspicious one,
aren't you?

323
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,920
And…

324
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,560
why are you so mad at Thame

325
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,920
for trying to reunite the group?

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,320
Do you hate your group that much?

327
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
So, are you starting
the interview already?

328
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
Well…

329
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
If you're going to interview me,
set up the camera.

330
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,960
And do we have a script?

331
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,880
It sounds as if you were going to read it.

332
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Here you are.

333
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
All right. I'm ready now.

334
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,320
Let's start. Camera.

335
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
Hold on.

336
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,520
Well, I want to know

337
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,960
if I can really mention
that game center story.

338
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
I don't know,

339
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,880
but Miss Pemika
already approved the script.

340
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,120
Okay?

341
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,440
Camera, speed.

342
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,320
Please say something to Thame.

343
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,720
{\an8}Thame, I'm so happy for you
that you've come this far,

344
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,240
{\an8}but it didn't surprise me much

345
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,560
{\an8}because I know you're a talented one.

346
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,560
I still remember the first day Pepper,
you, and I started as trainees together.

347
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
You were such a good boy
that it kind of annoyed me.

348
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
<i>When you arrived at the building,</i>
<i>you headed straight to the practice room,</i>

349
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,760
<i>without stopping anywhere.</i>

350
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>During our practice time,</i>

351
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,920
<i>you gave it your all.</i>

352
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,320
It was kind of surprising
that we became friends,

353
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,280
especially since I tricked you
into skipping classes.

354
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
Hey, let's go to the game center.

355
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,720
<i>Actually, back then,</i>

356
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
<i>I just wanted to make sure you'd have</i>
<i>a slightly lower score than mine,</i>

357
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,760
<i>so I might have a chance to pass</i>
<i>and stay as a trainee in the next round.</i>

358
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Hey, don't be tricky.

359
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,320
<i>I thought it'd be nice</i>
<i>if you got scolded a little,</i>

360
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,400
<i>but we both ended up</i>
<i>really getting scolded together.</i>

361
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,880
Are you the one
who made Thame go off track?

362
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,920
<i>But you just…</i>

363
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,200
It was my doing.

364
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,040
I asked him to come with me.

365
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't make excuses for your friend.

366
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,600
It's not an excuse.

367
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,000
I was just too exhausted,

368
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,880
so I wanted to do something apart
from the schedule.

369
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,880
If you're calling someone a victim,

370
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,920
it's supposed to be Jun.

371
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,680
If he already knew
his score wasn't that okay,

372
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
he should have asked me to go with him

373
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,800
and then sneaked off to practice alone,

374
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,680
not stayed together until the end, right?

375
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,480
You're my first friend in this group,

376
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,160
{\an8}and I'm your first friend
in this group, too.

377
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,320
{\an8}But from now on, I'm no longer with you,

378
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,160
{\an8}but I want you to remember

379
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,520
{\an8}that you'll always have me here.

380
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,640
Cut.

381
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,560
Let me check if I look handsome.

382
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
I'm handsome.

383
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,880
By the way, I have to shoot another scene.

384
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,120
Can you wait for me?

385
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,560
That slacker Mick
drove the group's van back already,

386
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,280
but he left his car key with me.

387
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,320
Drive for me, okay?

388
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
I'm too lazy to drive.

389
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,400
If you want my help,
why don't you talk nicely?

390
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,760
What I do with anyone
is my business, isn't it?

391
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,680
Also, I'm part of your job.

392
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,720
You must do it anyway, right?

393
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,560
So, wait for me.

394
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,720
I'll get going.

395
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,840
{\an8}MICK, I THINK I KNOW FOR SURE
WHO THAME'S SPY IS

396
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,800
Where do you want me to drop you off?

397
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Give me the key. I'll drive myself.

398
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,760
- Eh? You told me to drive for you.
- Come on. Just give it to me.

399
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,160
I just want someone to talk to,
so I won't feel sleepy.

400
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,960
Get in the car.

401
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,680
I'll go to Oner first.

402
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,480
You've got another job?

403
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeah.

404
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,560
What is it?

405
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,960
I'm grabbing you
and taking you to Miss Pemika.

406
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,640
<i>But no matter what the location is,</i>

407
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,440
<i>Thame is always ready to support me</i>
<i>as an "actor".</i>

408
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,240
<i>This is my true friend,</i>

409
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
<i>someone who's always ready to support me</i>
<i>on the path I've already chosen.</i>

410
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,200
JUN

411
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,720
<i>Thame, I've figured out</i>
<i>who's been helping you.</i>

412
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,360
Do you think
that interview clip can fool me?

413
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,240
From my work experience,

414
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,320
the length of each member's interview clip
is pretty close.

415
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,600
<i>Mine is 2.30 minutess,</i>

416
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,960
<i>but yours is one minute.</i>

417
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,760
I think you didn't even finish
that interview,

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,400
but the two of you might have
talked about something more afterward.

419
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,920
Jun, we didn't talk.

420
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,440
Also, the file sequence

421
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,920
is missing two files.

422
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,640
I believe you actually continued
the interview,

423
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,320
but it got moved out
of the camera already.

424
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
Where are you?

425
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,880
Are you still at the set?

426
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,680
<i>I already left,</i>

427
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,040
<i>and I'm not quite sure where this area is.</i>

428
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I'll hang up.

429
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
{\an8}PO
THERE'S NO SEARCH RESULT FOR "PO"

430
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
{\an8}<i>If something urgent is up…</i>

431
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,360
Jun, let's talk.

432
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
Sure thing.

433
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,680
Let's talk.

434
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,080
What did you say to him?

435
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,800
Why did he agree to come back again?

436
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,760
He didn't want to go
to Korea from the start.

437
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
It's not about
whether he wants to go or not.

438
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,240
It's just that he must go!

439
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,400
Why?

440
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
So you can become an actor?

441
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,000
If the group continues,

442
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,400
it's better for you, isn't it?

443
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,280
More people will recognize you.

444
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,840
This isn't about me
wanting to become an actor,

445
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,840
but it's about Thame.

446
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,160
If he doesn't go,
MARS is going to destroy him.

447
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,240
Huh?

448
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
How much did he tell you

449
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
about what he's done for the group?

450
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,440
Did he tell you

451
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,720
which contracts he's signed
with the company?

452
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,920
<i>Others might not suspect it</i>
<i>when his new single came out,</i>

453
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
<i>but I did.</i>

454
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,840
<i>The contracts they made him sign</i>
<i>to pay off the group's debt</i>

455
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,440
<i>put him at a disadvantage in every way.</i>

456
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,040
For what?!

457
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,640
Jun, there's no other way

458
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,200
to keep us as a group.

459
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,640
If we can't, then just don't do it.

460
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,040
But I'm trying to make it possible.

461
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,520
Trust me once, okay?

462
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,400
He ended up living his life
carrying four useless people.

463
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,440
{\an8}ARTIST SIGNATURE

464
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,040
When I found out
he got an offer from Korea,

465
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,480
I was so damn happy

466
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,080
because he wouldn't
have to carry the others anymore.

467
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
But now what?

468
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,120
What did you say to him?

469
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,640
Why did he agree to come back
and do this for the others again?

470
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,680
He should have learned
to be selfish sometimes.

471
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,160
Going to Korea
is the only way for him to get by.

472
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,720
Why are you smiling?

473
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,440
Are you so scared of getting fired
that you're out of your mind now, huh?

474
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,920
No.

475
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,120
I just started to understand

476
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,720
why Thame said you're really important

477
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
because, actually,

478
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,400
you love him the most.

479
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,480
What?

480
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,280
All you said means

481
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,640
you want him to have a good future, right?

482
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,720
Do you think I care about him?

483
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,480
Stop messing with this thing already.

484
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,280
Make him go to Korea,

485
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
or none of us will get by.

486
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,520
You said

487
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,640
you wanted Thame to be selfish, right?

488
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,120
I think what he's doing now
is really selfish.

489
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,640
He's doing this for the others.

490
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
How could you see that as selfish?

491
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,720
Thame is doing this for himself.

492
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
He's bringing the group back together
entirely for himself,

493
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,960
just so he doesn't feel guilty,

494
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,520
and to make up
for the leadership he failed to provide.

495
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,960
He's doing it

496
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,160
for what he wants to do now,

497
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,920
which is staying as a group.

498
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,320
Since your friend is being this selfish,

499
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,400
don't you want to support him somehow?

500
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,000
<i>So, how is it going?</i>

501
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,000
<i>Have you caught the traitor yet?</i>

502
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,520
<i>So, it's Po, right?</i>

503
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,800
No. It's not him.

504
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,800
Are you okay?

505
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,360
Relax, Thame.

506
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,480
I'm okay.

507
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,240
- It's true I got caught by Jun, but…
- What?

508
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,560
Why didn't you call me?

509
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
Eh?

510
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,880
If you wanted to help,
why didn't you call me?

511
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
I gave you my number,

512
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,520
but you didn't give me yours.

513
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,800
You're right.

514
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,520
Give me.

515
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,880
Give me.

516
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,920
Give me your number.

517
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
Is everything okay now?

518
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,159
Jun said he wants to talk to you.

519
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,719
You'd know where he is.

520
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
Why are you this stubborn, huh?

521
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,960
And why did you have someone lie to me
that you were the lead in that movie,

522
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,520
when I would find out anyway

523
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,280
when it's released?

524
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,400
If I didn't lie,

525
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,240
would you have agreed to go to Korea?

526
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,880
Thank you.

527
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
Are you out of your mind?

528
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,680
Why did you thank me?

529
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,360
Thanks for going back
to the group's house.

530
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,120
It's you

531
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,000
who watered the tree, right?

532
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,080
Don't think I'm into it or something.

533
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,040
Please, okay?

534
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,680
No one lives there,

535
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,160
and there's free water and electricity.

536
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,000
Why wouldn't I stay?

537
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,480
Fine.

538
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,400
And thanks

539
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
for punching me before Dylan did.

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,000
What the hell is damn wrong
with you, Thame?!

541
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,120
Don't! Let me do it.

542
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,080
Otherwise, my face would have been ruined.

543
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,960
Don't you think
I probably wanted to punch you for real?

544
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,560
Do you want to punch now?

545
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,120
<i>Make it higher than mine.</i>

546
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,680
You're such a noob, kiddo.

547
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
8,400 and 6,300.

548
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,640
8,600.

549
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,240
{\an8}DID YOU CLEAR THINGS UP WITH JUN?

550
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,640
HOW IS EVERYTHING?

551
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,600
ARE YOU OKAY?

552
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,320
JUN SAID YOU SIGNED A SLAVE CONTRACT

553
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,080
Hey?

554
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,400
I thought you were with Jun.

555
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,960
I cleared things up with him already,

556
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,640
but I've got a new problem now.

557
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What is it?

558
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
I don't have your number.

559
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,680
Huh?

560
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,720
Eh?

561
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,680
PO
THERE'S NO SEARCH RESULT FOR "PO"

562
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,080
Shit.

563
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,160
You gave it to me, but…

564
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,160
I forgot to save it.

565
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,400
I see.

566
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,000
Give me your phone.

567
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,000
I'll type it for you again.

568
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,120
It's all right.

569
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,040
I'm afraid I'll forget to save it again.

570
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,960
- So…
- Tell me your number.

571
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
I'll remember every single digit.

572
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,320
I don't want to forget it.

573
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,160
062…

574
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,720
062…

575
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,320
031…

576
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,760
031…

577
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,840
7745.

578
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
7745.

579
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,720
062

580
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,200
031

581
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,600
7745.

582
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,800
062

583
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
031

584
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,040
7745.

585
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,080
062

586
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,440
031

587
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,360
7745.

588
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,720
062

589
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,640
031

590
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,920
7745.

591
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,080
You want me to help
bring Nano back first, right?

592
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,680
Dylan.

593
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
<i>You're fucking fake!</i>

594
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
<i>I have a rap battle coming up.</i>
<i>Come join me.</i>

595
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,160
<i>Dylan is really not coming back</i>
<i>to join us.</i>

596
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,960
How stupid you are for coming here
just to let me humiliate you.

597
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,600
If we can find that song,
Dylan will probably agree to talk.

598
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,040
<i>Mick is here. Hide, both of you.</i>
