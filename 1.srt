1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,160
You’ve done some impressive work.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,520
You even won a short film competition.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,800
{\an8}You used to work in directing,

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,320
but you didn’t complete the project.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,000
And you haven’t worked
for three years now?

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,760
Well, at that time, I had to quit
to help out with things at home.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,640
That’s why I decided to work part-time
at a suit shop instead,

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,520
so I could take care of things
at home more easily.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,720
But now, I don’t have to anymore,

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
so I’m looking forward
to getting back to work.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
So, your home situation is sorted?

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Yes.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Well…

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,320
I broke up with my partner recently,

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,600
so I’m now ready to start working again.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,640
I’m fully committed to giving
my best at work.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,520
I’m fine starting as an Assistant 3,

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,440
and in 2-3 years, you can evaluate
whether I’m ready to move up to director.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
Let me be honest with you.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,400
I invited you for this interview

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,800
because we’re truly interested
in your work,

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
and we’re curious where you have been
during the time you stopped working,

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,520
but after learning your reason,

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
I’m hesitant to hire you.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,840
We’re worried that after we hire you

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
and you start dating again,

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,160
you might quit your job once again.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,040
Our company is looking for someone
who’s serious about work,

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
not someone who does it just for fun.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
If you want the job,

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
next time, you don’t need
to be this honest.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,920
Well, you failed again?

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,640
{\an8}Yes.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,880
{\an8}If it’s that hard to find a job,
why not start your own business?

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,160
{\an8}Look at this guy.

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,280
I think he’s about your age.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,640
He’s Earn, the owner of EarnChop.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,680
<i>And here are the features</i>
<i>of our app, EarnChop.</i>

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,480
{\an8}<i>Apart from making video editing easier,</i>

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,080
{\an8}<i>- it will also make your videos unique.</i>
- He’s cool.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
{\an8}He deserves to be a role model.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,080
{\an8}<i>It’s perfect for beginners</i>
<i>or even for experts.</i>

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,560
{\an8}<i>Turning your VDOs into…</i>

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Here you are.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,160
Two for you, as usual.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
Well, I’m living alone now.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
{\an8}Pardon?

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Nothing.

49
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120

50

<i>This week is the alumni gathering.</i>
<i>I’ve already booked for everyone.</i>

51
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,920
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>if anyone is bringing a plus one.</i>

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,560
<i>Po, will I see you there?</i>

53

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
{\an8}MOM

55
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,640
Hello, Mom?

56
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,360
<i>Po, how was your job interview yesterday?</i>

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,400
I got the offer already, Mom. Don’t worry.

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,240
<i>Really?</i>

59
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,240
<i>I knew you’d make it.</i>

60
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,360
<i>So, how is it?</i>
<i>When are you starting your new job?</i>

61
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Well,

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
it’s next Monday.

63
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
<i>Monday?</i>

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,960
PUBLIC HOLIDAY - COMPENSATORY HOLIDAY

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
<i>Good luck on your job, then.</i>

66
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Thank you.

MONEY TRANSFERRED IN
FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNT 0127-xxxx-xxx

72
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
- AMOUNT: 10,000 BAHT
<i>- Good luck with your job search.</i>

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,560
Eh? What’s with that face?

74
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,600
I'm already this old,
and my parents are still sending me money.

75
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,360
If I were you,

76
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
with parents taking care of me this much,

77
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,480
I wouldn't bother looking for a job.

78
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,960
I need to work and pay them back
the money anyway, Uncle.

79
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,760
Who would do what you did,

80
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,480
telling the truth,
so they ended up not hiring you?

81
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,560
They would think
you’re clingy to your partner.

82
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,280
But you really are clingy, huh?

83
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,760
You pushed him until he became the CEO.

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Next time, don’t tell them everything,

85
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,880
or you’ll end up working here forever

86
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,880
and never get the job you want. Got it?

87
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,240
Po, I’ve got work for you.

88
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,440
I want a job, but not from you.

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>I told you to do it, so just do it.</i>

90
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,280
<i>Now, turn on your computer.</i>

91
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay, fade in.

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,440
Then, insert a text.

93
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
<i>Add an effect, too.</i>

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,600
<i>Make it cool, not dull.</i>

95
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,280
As for me, I hope you get caught.

96
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,120
Before I get caught,
add the sound effect for me first.

97
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000
<i>It’s in the second file.</i>

98
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,640
<i>Let’s go with… verse 2.</i>

99
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,840
It’s an exciting verse.

100
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,799
This one?

101
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,120
Don’t do anything beyond my instructions!

102
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Which account is she dealing with?
That sounds pretty intense.

103
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,200
Dude, my kiddos are so cute!

104
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
This is it!

105
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,080
The future of the T-POP industry is
definitely promising because of my kiddos!

106
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Look at my bias!

107
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,280
Pepper, my son!

108
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
He’s lovey-dovey adorable!

109
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
By the way,

110
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,800
you've been editing so many clips for me.

111
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,960
Don't you feel anything?

112
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>There must be someone you’re attracted to.</i>

113
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,800
I’ll let you pick your bias.

114
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,240
<i>Choose one.</i>

115
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
These five?

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,120
I don’t really have a favorite.

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,160
How could you not fall for my kiddos?

118
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
<i>Fine. That’s up to you.</i>

119
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
MONEY TRANSFERRED IN
FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNT 4133-xxxx-xxx

120
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
<i>That’s your pay.</i>

121
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,320
AMOUNT: 7,760 BAHT

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
You're another one.

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,760
- Stop sending me money already.
- <i>Eh?</i>

124
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,080
I hired you to work, so I must pay you.

125
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,080
<i>Why? Or do you want to work</i>
<i>for me for free?</i>

126
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,240
Just forget about it.

127
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,800
You must go
to the alumni gathering this Saturday.

128
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,960
<i>Tell our friends you’re working with me,</i>

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
<i>so you’ll get to go out and meet people.</i>

130
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,520
Maybe you'll even find yourself a new guy.

131
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,400
But I literally have nothing now.

132
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,040
If you have nothing,

133
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
at least you might get yourself a guy.

134
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,440
I’ll hang up now. Work’s in.

135
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
What is it?

136
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,720
Baifern, Mick, MARS’ manager,
is here to see you.

137
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,640
Okay, sure. I’ll be there in a minute.

138
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
By the way, which account
were you dealing with just now?

139
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,920
That was so intense.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,160
Account M.

141
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,040
- Which M?
- No idea.

142
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
Hello, Mr. Mick.

143
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Hello, Miss Baifern.

144
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
- Please make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

145
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Today, I brought a gift basket
to thank you for choosing MARS

146
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,960
as the new product's brand ambassador.

147
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,840
The members actually
wanted to come themselves,

148
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,600
but their schedule
has been really tight recently.

149
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,880
We’re preparing for a big project now.

150
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
A big project?

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Can you drop a little spoiler?

152
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,800
I can’t, Miss Baifern.

153
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,160
But I’m under stress now

154
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,280
because I still haven’t found
a talented documentary director.

155
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,200
I want a director
to film the footage of the members.

156
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,760
Is it that hard to find?

157
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
Exactly.

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,880
The person must keep the project secret.

159
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,200
You know, people these days
can’t keep things quiet.

160
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
You’re right.

161
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,400
But actually, I know someone
who is qualified.

162
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,880
Would you like their contact information?

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,080
Hurry up, dude.

164
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,480
Hey.

165
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,320
Can we not do this?

166
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
You found me a job,

167
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
but it's about
digging up information on MARS?

168
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,320
I’m not making you dig up
their information.

169
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,840
I just want you to have
a good life and get hired.

170
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,800
I believe in you.

171
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,320
If you do this job well,

172
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,720
you'll become so famous and successful

173
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
that you can even step all over
that jerk Earn’s face,

174
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
the one who said you suck, man.

175
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,640
You’re a new person now,

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,400
about to film a documentary for MARS!

177
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,080
You must get hired, no matter what.

178
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
This is what you need to say

179
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,800
because it’s what I’ve sold to Mick
about you.

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Oh? What did you say to him?

181
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,280
You made up my profile.

182
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,720
How real do you want your profile?

183
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,360
Do you want me to include
you creating a logo for that jerk Earn,

184
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,520
who dumped you afterward?

185
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,280
No, thanks.

186
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,680
Then go with my version.

187
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,520
It's based on a true story. Let’s go.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,680
{\an8}Hurry up. My kiddos are waiting.

189
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,720
MR. PAWAT NUENGANAN
INTERESTED POSITION: VIDEO DIRECTOR

190
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
You won a short film competition.

191
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,080
After that,

192
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,040
you have been highly experienced
in the fashion industry for four years.

193
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
What did you do?

194
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Previously, I used to shoot
private sessions for celebrities.

195
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,640
You’re Mr. Sombat, right?

196
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,720
I’ve been a fan of your dramas for ages.

197
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,360
- Po, come take some pictures for me.
- Sure. My pleasure.

198
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,160
One, two, three.

199
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,200
I also used to take candid
behind-the-scenes shots for artists.

200
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,280
<i>Also, I added effects</i>
<i>and did some editing work.</i>

201
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,800
<i>That’s a well-rounded set of skills</i>
<i>you’ve got.</i>

202
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,240
By the way, since you want to work
with Oner Entertainment,

203
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
how well do you know us?

204
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,000
Oner Entertainment is a full-fledged
entertainment industry company.

205
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,640
<i>It includes solo artists,</i>

206
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
{\an8}<i>boy bands, and girl groups.</i>

207
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,240
The artist that has gained the most fame

208
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,280
and made the most money is MARS.

209
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,080
MARS has been successful
since their second album.

210
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,480
Their song was a massive hit.

211
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
Everyone can sing along
and dance to their song.

212
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>The advertising work is pouring in,</i>

213
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,000
<i>and as for photoshoots,</i>
<i>don’t even mention it,</i>

214
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>big-name brands are reaching out.</i>

215
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,320
So, MARS is the top income generator
for the company

216
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,760
because the five of them
are the perfect formula for an idol group.

217
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,360
<i>Jun is a supporting vocalist,</i>

218
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,600
{\an8}<i>with a friendly and playful look.</i>

219
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,920
<i>He’s a bit cheeky but full of charisma.</i>

220
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,920
<i>Dylan is the group’s rapper.</i>

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,440
<i>He’s taciturn, speaks little,</i>
<i>and finds it hard to smile,</i>

222
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,960
<i>but it's that indifferent look</i>
<i>that wins the fans' hearts.</i>

223
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,840
<i>Pepper is a heart-warming all-rounder.</i>

224
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,400
<i>He’s such a gentle friend.</i>

225
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
<i>Just seeing him already warms your heart.</i>

226
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,040
<i>Nano is the main dancer,</i>
<i>the golden maknae of the group.</i>

227
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,440
<i>Though he’s the youngest,</i>

228
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
<i>he’s lively,</i>

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
<i>with an impressive performance</i>
<i>that is way beyond his years.</i>

230
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,240
<i>Lastly, Thame is the group leader,</i>
<i>who is the heart and soul of the group.</i>

231
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,640
<i>He excels at both singing and dancing</i>
<i>with a handsome look.</i>

232
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,680
<i>He’s definitely the most</i>
<i>well-rounded leader T-pop has ever seen.</i>

233
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,240
MARS is also known for being united.

234
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,640
The members love each other a lot.

235
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,400
After the five gathered,

236
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,560
their chemistry turned out super perfect.

237
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,840
Did I… say something wrong?

238
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,280
Hey,

239
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,840
are you a fan
pretending to apply for a job?

240
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,440
You really can’t let him know
you once worked for a fanbase account.

241
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,560
This company is really serious about
fans pretending to be part of the staff.

242
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
I did stalk and photograph them
once at an event for you.

243
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,600
- Do you think they’ll remember my face?
- You only went once,

244
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,920
and when it was time to see them,

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
you put your camera away.

246
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,080
There were thousands of fans,

247
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
so they wouldn’t recognize you.

248
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,240
Anyway, you need to be careful

249
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,400
{\an8}and make sure not to slip up!

250
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,760
Once I found out I had to work with MARS,

251
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,960
I made sure to do my homework in advance,

252
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,480
but due to the tight timeline,

253
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,359
I was only able to learn this much.

254
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,359
All right.

255
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,440
Let’s get down to it.

256
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,920
What is your expected salary?

257
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,880
Nice.

258
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,480
Smile.

259
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,920
One, two.

260
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,840
Move a bit to the right. Okay.

261
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,320
Here you are.

262
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,800
As for the job details,
you can ask Ming and Tae over there.

263
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,880
As for me,

264
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,640
I’m feeling sleepy, so I’ll take a nap.

265
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,760
PAWAT NUENGANAN, CREATIVE

266
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Please go ahead, mom and kids.

267
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,720
Are you a newbie?

268
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,760
Are you?

269
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,480
I truly apologize.

270
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,080
I didn’t know
you’re the CEO of Oner, Miss Pemika.

271
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
Don’t I look like myself on the news?

272
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Well, you look more beautiful in person.

273
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,920
Where is Mick, by the way?

274
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
Has he explained the job details to you?

275
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,720
Well…

276
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,680
I’m here. Here I am.

277
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,480
I just went to the restroom,

278
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,400
but I already explained
all the job details to him.

279
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,960
His first task is to film footage

280
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,920
for the MARS
behind-the-scenes documentary,

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
which will be showcased
at their big concert

282
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,880
happening in three months,

283
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,920
called "Dream to MARS".

284
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,840
Great job, Mick.

285
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,760
Mainly, I want you to film
the footage of the five members.

286
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,960
Then, have Mick check them weekly.

287
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,680
This task is within
your three-month probation.

288
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,320
If you do a good job,

289
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I’ll consider you having passed
with flying colors.

290
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
Give it your all to make it worthy
of being their last concert.

291
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,160
Their last concert?

292
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Mick hasn’t told you about this?

293
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,960
Ming and Tae haven’t told you anything?

294
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
These kids.

295
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,880
{\an8}But it’s your job, isn’t it?

296
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,400
{\an8}Hey, let me tell you this.

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,200
Whether it’s our job or not

298
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,560
depends on how our heart decides.

299
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,200
{\an8}By the way,

300
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,520
{\an8}have you used your employee card
to get free coffee yet?

301
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,600
- I haven’t.
- You haven’t?

302
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,080
Let me borrow yours
to get myself some coffee then.

303
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,960
I’m so tired.
I think I need lots of cups today.

304
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,240
Oh, sure.

305
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,440
But you haven’t explained
about their last concert yet.

306
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,640
Here they are.

307
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,040
Ming and Tae will explain it.

308
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,760
It’s a long story. I’m lazy.

309
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,320
{\an8}See you around.

310
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,000
I knew it.
That slacker Mick is skipping work again.

311
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,160
So, we brought this stuff for you. Ta-da!

312
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,400
I’m Ming, and this is Tae.

313
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,320
- I’m Po.
- I see.

314
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,760
Give me a second.

315
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,160
Here’s the camera. Take it.

316
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,320
I’ll put the drive on your desk later.

317
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,240
If there’s anything you don’t understand,
feel free to ask Tae.

318
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,320
I told you already, I’m not going.

319
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,160
But charity work is good
for your image, Thame.

320
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,840
I’m not available.

321
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Why are you so demanding with me? Huh?

322
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,320
But I think you should go.

323
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,760
This event only invites
top-tier celebrities.

324
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
It won’t take long.

325
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,200
You'll be able to get back
on schedule anyway.

326
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,680
I promise it’ll be no more than an hour.

327
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,040
I’ll call and have them move the breakdown
so they can shoot you first.

328
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,200
Okay?

329
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,600
So, I just take the elevator down,
shoot for an hour, and that’s it?

330
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,520
Thame, please.
I’ll sort it out for you right now.

331
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,200
Miss Aoy,

332
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,560
could you please reschedule Thame's slot
and have him shoot first?

333
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
Ice is fine with that.

334
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,000
Ice can wait.

335
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Yes.

336
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,320
Are you a sasaeng? Are you?

337
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,120
Well,

338
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,640
I’m not.

339
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040
You’re not?

340
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,240
You look familiar.

341
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,520
Let me check.

342
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
What did you film?

343
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
And who let a sasaeng in?

344
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,680
You two?

345
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Relax, Thame. He’s not a sasaeng.

346
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,040
He’s the new director who will film
a documentary for your group.

347
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Huh? Where is his employee card?

348
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,560
Mick borrowed it to get some coffee.

349
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,560
Let's just say everything is fine, Thame.

350
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Really?

351
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,160
Delete whatever you just filmed then.

352
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,440
He’ll do that for sure.

353
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,360
Right?

354
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
Delete them. Now.

355
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,240
But actually,

356
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,720
there are so many people
obsessed with artists

357
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,120
who sneak in pretending to be staff.

358
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
Two for you, as usual.

359
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,920
BAIFERN

360
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,640
Hello?

361
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
<i>Hey, how was it?</i>

362
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,120
<i>Are all my kiddos nice?</i>

363
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
<i>Which members did you meet?</i>

364
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
Thame.

365
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,400
<i>Is he really that cute in person?</i>

366
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,960
Well, yeah.

367
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,600
<i>And what is their big project coming up?</i>

368
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
<i>Can you tell me?</i>

369
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,080
DREAM TO MARS CONCERT PRESS CONFERENCE

<i>When do the tickets go on sale?</i>

374

387
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,320
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>
<i>all members of the press</i>

388
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,680
{\an8}<i>and MARS fans to our press conference.</i>

389
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,000
{\an8}I want to check it one last time.

390
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,240
That’s too late now.
We don’t have time for that.

391
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,400
<i>…please proceed to Entrance 2.</i>

392
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
<i>For those who do not have tickets yet…</i>

393
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,680
Well…

394
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,720
I want to know
why it’s their last concert.

395
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,240
<i>And for fans who already have tickets,</i>

396
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,840
<i>the prize redemption counter</i>
<i>is located in front of the entrance.</i>

397
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,960
I want to know because

398
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,480
I have to figure out
how to edit the footage I film.

399
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,640
I’m looking at you because I’m confused.

400
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
I’m confused
Mick didn’t tell you anything.

401
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,480
Like, literally nothing?

402
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,600
Anyway, just keep filming for now.

403
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,320
When I’m available,
I’ll tell you about it later.

404
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,920
The members are in the dressing room.
You can head there and film them now.

405
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,960
- Got it.
- Yeah.

406
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,240
{\an8}Everything is done. It’s ready.
We’re good to go.

407
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,400
The right side.

408
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,440
The right side.

409
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,160
Uh-huh.

410
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,680
Which side again?

411
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,600
The right one.

412
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,280
- Sun and Pom.
- Yes?

413
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,520
Thame is here.

414
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,000
{\an8}I LOVE THAME -
DYLAN THAME, YOU'RE SO CUTE

415
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,320
<i>Why, oh why? Tell me what's on your mind</i>

416
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,760
<i>What will you do to make things right?</i>

417
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,560
<i>You stole my heart in the blink of an eye</i>

418
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
<i>You stole my heart</i>

419
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
<i>Stole my heart</i>

420
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,760
<i>I’m yours from the first time we met</i>

421
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,400
<i>This story isn't over yet</i>

422
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,080
<i>Give us a chance, and we're all set</i>

423
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,520
<i>I might be the one, baby</i>

424
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
<i>Where do I go to file my complaint?</i>

425
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
<i>What you did to me, it just ain't right</i>

426
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,400
<i>Won't back down, won't compromise</i>

427
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,600
<i>Until you say you'll be my girl tonight</i>

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,320
<i>The damages I need you to pay?</i>

429
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,240
<i>All I need is</i>

430
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,760
<i>You… you… you</i>

431
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,720
<i>You… you… you</i>

432
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,880
<i>You… you… you</i>

433
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,920
<i>All I need is you</i>

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,720
<i>You came and crashed, hit me with a smash</i>

435
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,720
<i>Slipped right into my heart in a flash</i>

436
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,720
<i>You left your mark right on my heart</i>

437
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,960
- <i>Can’t stop thinking about you</i>
- <i>You</i>

438
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,720
<i>So, how will you guarantee it’ll be fine?</i>

439
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,520
<i>If you want to mediate</i>
<i>Bring your heart to the line</i>

440
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,560
<i>Let’s trade, let’s have a new start</i>
<i>Heal my heart with your heart</i>

441
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,160
<i>And pay me back with your love</i>
<i>We’ll call it even</i>

442
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,800
<i>You… you… you</i>

443
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,200
{\an8}<i>You… you… you</i>

444
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,360
<i>'Cause all I need</i>
<i>Oh, 'cause all I need is you</i>

445
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
<i>Please give MARS a round of applause!</i>

446
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,800
Wow. I couldn’t stop myself
from dancing along.

447
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
You all are amazing.

448
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,600
{\an8}Louder, please!
Can you go louder, please?!

449
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,480
Okay. Welcome everyone to MARS Quake.

450
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,320
This is just an appetizer of the project
we’re announcing today.

451
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,440
Everyone, are you ready
for the announcement?

452
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,240
Yes!

453
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,400
That wasn’t loud enough. Are you ready?

454
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes!

455
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,160
The project we’re announcing today

456
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,960
is MARS’ big concert!

457
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,760
Dreams to MARS!

458
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Let each member talk about this concert.

459
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,520
- Thame, please go ahead.
- All right.

460
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,080
Yes.

461
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,960
In the next three months,
we guarantee it will be more fun.

462
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,520
Dreams to MARS Concert is the gift
we’re determined to give to everyone.

463
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
Most importantly,

464
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,240
we’ve prepared a surprise.

465
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,680
{\an8}NANO - THAME - DYLAN THAME, YOU'RE SO CUTE

466
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,120
Oh? A surprise?

467
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,360
Yes, but let’s keep it a secret for now.

468
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,400
Wow. Since it sounds this interesting,

469
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,600
you can’t miss out on the tickets, right?

470
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,800
But today, we’ve got another surprise.

471
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,280
Thame is going to perform
his solo single, right?

472
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

473
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,440
Now, the stage is yours, Thame!

474
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,960
{\an8}NANO - PEPPER - THAME THAME FC

475
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,320
<i>It’s alright, I just have to understand</i>

476
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,560
<i>It’s alright</i>

477
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,880
<i>Though all the dreams we had</i>

478
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,480
<i>Didn’t go as planned, I understand</i>

479
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,240
<i>I still breathe</i>
<i>Because of the word love from you</i>

480
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,760
<i>Remembering this feeling so true</i>

481
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,120
<i>My heart cherishes the memory of us</i>

482
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,280
To be honest,

483
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,360
the group came this far because of Thame.

484
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,840
{\an8}LOVE THAME - THAME - NANO
THAME, YOU'RE SO CUTE

485
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,400
After he got his solo single

486
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,880
and became more famous
than the other members,

487
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,080
a Korean company showed interest
in signing him for a solo contract.

488
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,600
After Thame said yes,

489
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
the group had to disband

490
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,560
because it wouldn’t be worth it

491
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,120
for the company to continue investing
in the remaining four.

492
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Even though the group was formed
with all five members,

493
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,280
when a great opportunity comes along,

494
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,200
they have to choose to grow
and move forward.

495
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,320
Am I right?

496
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
You’re here.

497
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,800
Do you want to take some rest first?

498
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, let’s start, then.

499
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,560
Camera, speed.

500
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,520
Please say something to your members.

501
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,199
Thame?

502
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,120
At our fan meeting at Oner Hall,

503
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,120
you were filming me
while I was about to get in the van.

504
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,640
<i>There were tons of cameras there.</i>

505
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,040
I believe…

506
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,440
some cameras might have captured
your face,

507
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
and I was right.

508
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,680
Will you resign on your own,

509
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,920
or do you want me… to show this footage…

510
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,520
to the management team,

511
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,360
and then you’ll get fired

512
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,760
for being a sasaeng?

513
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,160
Thame, listen up.

514
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,720
- It’s not what you think.
- Who’s that then?

515
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,520
Huh?

516
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,800
Isn’t that you?

517
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,120
How much information have you gathered
so far about our group?

518
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,680
It’s not what you think, Thame.

519
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
- Well, that day…
- Stop it already.

520
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,960
I think you should explain this
to Miss Pemika.

521
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Hand it to me,

522
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
so my group’s reputation won’t be ruined

523
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,840
because of a sasaeng like you.

524
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,960
Hand it to me.

525
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
PAWAT NUENGANAN, CREATIVE

526
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
Even if I weren’t here,

527
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,920
your group’s reputation would still
be ruined because of you, wouldn’t it?

528
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,040
What?

529
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,320
You're claiming that

530
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,080
you don't want
your group’s reputation to be ruined,

531
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,000
but in reality,

532
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,200
you just don't want yours to be ruined

533
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,840
because I happen to know

534
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
how selfish you are.

535
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,400
You're just…

536
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,120
someone who, after becoming
a little more successful than others,

537
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,160
forgets that the people
who've been with you…

538
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
also have feelings.

539
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,640
Thank you, everyone, for coming
to the launch event of my company.

540
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,280
Thank you for all the support,

541
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,320
whether from our sponsors, clients,

542
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
and…

543
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,040
all the kind prominent figures
in the IT industry.

544
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,720
Thank you very much. Cheers!

545
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,000
<i>They’ve never cared about</i>

546
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,800
<i>how the people behind them feel.</i>

547
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,440
<i>Someone like you is exactly the type</i>

548
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,000
who never values those who’ve been
on this journey with you.

549
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,040
<i>I just don’t like the font.</i>

550
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
And can you make it smaller?

551
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,680
It overlaps with the logo.

552
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
And what’s this? Where does it reflect
the essence of EarnChop?

553
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,640
TAKE CARE OF IT!

554
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,880
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

555
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
How could you do that?

556
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,800
When the opportunity suddenly came,

557
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,400
you chose to leave those who have
been with you for so many years

558
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,960
and get by alone.

559
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Can we talk?

560
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
- Just now, you…
- Uncle.

561
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,800
- Hello.
- Hi.

562
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,360
Have you got any suggestion
for a new entrepreneur like me?

563
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,120
<i>What about the things others did for you</i>
<i>when you had more jobs coming in?</i>

564
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,880
Aren’t they meaningful to you,
even a little?

565
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,280
Thank you for everything this whole time.

566
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,200
<i>You know what?</i>

567
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
What you’ve done

568
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,320
makes it impossible
for the people behind you to understand

569
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,720
why they’ve wasted so many years with you,

570
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,200
doing things for you.

571
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,240
You’re so damn selfish.

572
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,240
You have no right to say this

573
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
while you totally know nothing.

574
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,640
I know.

575
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,000
I know exactly
what kind of person you are!

576
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
I also know

577
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,760
how painful it is…

578
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,800
for those who are left behind.

579
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
How about the person
who has to leave them?

580
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,120
Don’t you think that hurts, too?

581
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,960
To get to this point,

582
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,560
do you think it has been easy?

583
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,960
Of course, it’s easy to understand
the pain those who get left behind get,

584
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,400
but the one who does the leaving

585
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,080
is just as hurt.

586
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,160
<i>So, I’ve booked you</i>
<i>for the alumni gathering this Saturday.</i>

587
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,720
<i>Brag to everyone that you're a director.</i>

588
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,040
<i>Spill the tea about how awful</i>
<i>that jerk Earn is to everyone.</i>

589
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,800
THIS WEEK IS THE ALUMNI GATHERING
I’VE ALREADY BOOKED FOR EVERYONE

590
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,680
LET ME KNOW
IF ANYONE IS BRINGING A PLUS ONE

591
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,520
- Hey, I have a question.
- <i>What is it?</i>

592
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,040
Does the person who leaves others behind…

593
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,320
feel hurt?

594
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,720
<i>What mood are you in, huh?</i>

595
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
<i>Or did that jerk Earn</i>
<i>say something to you again?</i>

596
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,840
It has nothing to do with him.

597
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
I’m just curious.

598
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,680
How could someone who does that feel hurt?

599
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,640
<i>So, he did that?</i>

600
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,840
<i>You used a trump card, didn’t you?</i>

601
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,760
<i>It was a trump card.</i>

602
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,400
<i>Come on, I just didn’t want to work.</i>

603
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,600
<i>And if they feel hurt,</i>

604
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,800
<i>why would they do it?</i>

605
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,640
<i>I don’t know.</i>

606
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,960
<i>If you’re curious, ask them.</i>

607
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,440
{\an8}I KNOW ONER

608
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,120
Tell me

609
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,680
if you’re just a fan or a sasaeng.

610
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,640
Neither.

611
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,800
It’s true

612
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,320
that I once got hired by your fan

613
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,560
and attended your event.

614
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,240
But it was only once.

615
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,520
<i>I didn’t think you’d remember me.</i>

616
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,360
<i>That’s because you’re different</i>
<i>from others.</i>

617
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah?

618
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,200
Anyway,

619
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,000
I’m not doing that anymore.

620
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,480
I just…

621
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,120
Just continue your job, then.

622
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,720
You’re doing well.

623
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,840
You’ve made me see my members
in a way I haven’t in a long time.

624
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,320
{\an8}<i>I think I can manage.</i>

625
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,560
{\an8}- <i>That’s a contrasting color.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

626
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,200
{\an8}<i>Cut, cut. Thank you so much.</i>

627
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,480
If you want me to continue with this job,

628
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,320
the person I want to get to know the most…

629
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,880
is you.

630
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,640
Yesterday, I still didn't get
any good footage.

631
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,080
<i>We’ve got no time left, Po.</i>
<i>Thame is heading to Korea soon.</i>

632
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,840
But I’ve only known Thame for a day.

633
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,440
<i>If you want to interview him, do it now.</i>

634
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,400
Honestly, how do you feel?

635
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,640
