1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,120
<i>I want you to film</i>
<i>the footage of the five members</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,800
to make it worthy
of being their last concert.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,360
Their last concert?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>After he got his solo single</i>

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,440
<i>and became more famous</i>
<i>than the others,</i>

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,920
<i>a Korean company showed interest</i>
<i>in signing him for a solo contract.</i>

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>How could you do that?</i>

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>When the opportunity suddenly came,</i>

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
you chose to leave those
who have been with you for many years

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,480
and get by alone.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,960
How about the person
who has to leave them?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,880
<i>Don’t you think that hurts, too?</i>

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,240
If you want me to continue with this job,
the person I want to get to know the most

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,560
is you.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,200
Hello? What’s up?

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,680
Hey.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,920
Imagine there are

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,160
<i>Mr. A and Mr. B.</i>

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,520
Mr. A said…

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
If you want me to continue with this job,

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,400
the person I want to get to know the most

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,960
is you.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,640
If it’s just for work,

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
that’s not necessary.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,800
What if it’s not for work?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you think Mr. B would take it

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,560
as more than a coworker thing?

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,920
Like, would he think
Mr. A has a crush on him?

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,280
Because after that question,

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,320
he just walked away.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,240
<i>Do you think he felt awkward</i>
<i>about the question Mr. A asked?</i>

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,720
Are you Mr. A or Mr. B?

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,040
It’s just hypothetical.

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,960
Fine, if you say so.

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,760
But after hearing this,

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
one thing I can guess

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,680
is Mr. A definitely has a crush on Mr. B.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
No way!

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,840
When he said he wanted to understand,

40
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
he meant just that, to understand.

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
There’s no crush involved.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,200
<i>It’s just like when coworkers</i>
<i>understand each other.</i>

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,800
Fine.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Mr. A doesn’t like Mr. B.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,800
But I think, now,

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,680
I bet Mr. B thinks
Mr. A has a crush on him.

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,680
What’s up?

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
I’m just getting some water.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,560
About last night…

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
I won’t tell anyone about
our conversation last night.

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,800
But…

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
I want to clear something up

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,600
because you probably misunderstood.

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
The sentence was that clear.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,640
How could I misunderstand?

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,480
Eh?

58
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
It wasn’t that clear, was it?

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,880
- I think it was so clear that you…
- Thame!

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
I didn’t mean it in a romantic way.

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Huh?

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,920
How did it have something to do
with being romantic?

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,360
Well…

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,080
I mean,

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,840
I won’t tell anyone

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,160
that I misunderstood you were a sasaeng.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,160
I see.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
I thought you were
talking about something else.

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Something else?

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
What is it?

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,520
Well…

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,480
I see.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,760
You mentioned about

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,120
something more than coworkers?

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,240
No. Nothing like that.

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,360
Was that romantic?

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,840
- Well, the thing is…
- Thame. Let’s get your makeup done.

78
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Yes.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,640
Hey, Po.

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,280
How was the footage you filmed yesterday?

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
I’m sorry.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
I was too tired to work yesterday.

83
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,480
I partied too hard.

84
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,440
Well,

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,840
yesterday,
I still didn’t get any good footage.

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,000
A lot happened yesterday,

87
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,920
so I…

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
This isn’t right, Po.

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,200
I hired you to work,

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,000
so I want you to do it well.

91
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Think about it.

92
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,840
If you can’t do it well,

93
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,000
how much damage
will it cause to someone like me?

94
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,880
Po.

95
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,160
I’m a senior here,

96
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
whom everyone respects.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,440
Yes.

98
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,840
I just think

99
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
I need a little more time.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,920
We’ve got no time left, Po.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,760
Thame is heading to Korea soon.

102
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,680
He has to learn the language there.

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,400
He’ll head back
just one week before the concert.

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
If you want to interview him, do it now.

105
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
But…

106
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,560
I’ve only known Thame for a day.

107
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,960
Come on.

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
Someone like Thame

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,760
can give you the footage you want
without you even knowing him well.

110
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Bro, is it you or me filming
for the first set?

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
It’s you, of course.

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,400
They must film
your face shot first, anyway,

113
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,920
but I’ve secretly seen they’ve
prepared a stand-in for your back shot.

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,760
I’m sorry

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,640
for jumping ahead
in your breakdown queue yesterday.

116
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
I was confused, too.

117
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,240
You said you wouldn’t come
but suddenly showed up.

118
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,040
At first, I didn’t think I would,

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,520
but things turned out that way.

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,760
Do you enjoy

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
when people gossip
that you are a big-name celeb

122
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,440
who is self-centered and demanding?

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,440
It’s easier that way, isn’t it?

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,160
{\an8}THAME

125
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,960
Who put it here?

126
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,320
I asked who did it!

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,800
I’m sorry.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,240
Nobody did that. Everything is fine.

129
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
Please excuse me.

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,240
Hello.

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,080
Hello.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

134
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,559
How have you been, Thame, Ice?

135
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,559
- I’m good.
- I’m good.

136
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,720
Have you tasted
our new flavor snack?

137
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,600
Of course. It’s very delicious.

138
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,000
Please take care of it for me today.

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
- Sure.
- Please don’t worry about it.

140
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
- Ming.
- Yeah?

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,480
Did you bring the gifts
members are giving to Thame?

142
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Are they all here?

143
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,800
Of course.

144
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,240
Here. Gloves, socks,

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,560
a coat, and a scarf.

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,280
See? You’d better worry about yourself.

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,520
Did you miss out on anything?

148
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
If you did again,
I’d call you Mick Number 2.

149
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Oh, come on.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,960
I won’t ruin your reputation, Miss Ming.

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
- Here.
- That’s good to hear.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
I brought some, too.

153
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,440
- Here.
- Show me.

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,840
These are birthstones
Thame is going to give his members.

155
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,280
See? Do you think it’s a good idea?

156
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
Almost.

157
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,080
You’re almost turning into Mick Number 2.

158
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
- Eh?
- Hey.

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,800
Pepper’s stone should
be amethyst, not crystal.

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Hey, come on.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,960
Figuring out what gifts they should
give each other to create moments

162
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,160
was tiring enough.

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,760
How could I have time to check
if the stones were correct?

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
Let’s put it this way.
How about switching to lucky stones,

165
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,960
so months won’t matter?

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
- You silly!
- Ow!

167
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
But it’s better than
getting the wrong month.

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,280
Po, you’re here just in time.

169
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
Let me see your hand.

170
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,600
Your hand.

171
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Perfect. Follow me.

172
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Come with me. Come, come.

173
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,280
You’re here just at the right time.

174
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,560
We’re almost there.

175
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,680
Here.

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,960
All right.

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,240
Put your chin in his hand.

178
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
All right.

179
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Smile a bit.

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,560
Smile.

181
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,520
By the way,

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,320
you read the script already, right?

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,880
Let me tweak it a bit.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,800
You won’t give them birthstones anymore

185
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,520
because we bought the wrong one.

186
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,720
Let’s say they’re lucky stones.

187
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,920
- Deal?
- Okay.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
Okay.

189
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,000
Come.

190
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,520
Hurry up.

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,640
What a relief.

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,920
This looks more like his recent photo.

193
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Luckily, we’ve got a great hand talent.

194
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,840
If I had to ask each member
to pose one by one,

195
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
I bet it would take forever.

196
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,480
It wouldn’t be finished in 30 years.

197
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,520
Thanks a lot.

198
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
Are we missing something else?

199
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
How about adding more photos?

200
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,120
Here you are. These are the gifts
you’re giving to each member.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Got it.

202
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
I’m putting them here.

203
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,720
Hey, did you forget
to arrange the meeting time?

204
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Me?

205
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
It’s Mick’s job.

206
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Eh?

207
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Ugh, he’s giving me trouble again.

208
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
As expected. No response yet.

209
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,920
I’ll call Jun and Pepper.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,480
You call Dylan and Nano.

211
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Give me their numbers.

212
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,360
What? All right.

213
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,920
- Call them, meanwhile.
- Okay.

214
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,520
Nobody is picking up.

215
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Same here.

216
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,400
Who else can we call? Let’s keep calling.

217
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
Come on.

218
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,760
I have this number.

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,680
Po, please help bring back
the rest of the stuff.

220
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,920
Hey, I have a question.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,880
<i>What is it?</i>

222
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
<i>Whenever Jun sleeps in other provinces,</i>

223
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,240
<i>he has trouble falling asleep.</i>

224
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,840
<i>He feels worried and often has nightmares.</i>

225
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,520
<i>Dylan is an analog boy.</i>

226
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
<i>Whenever he works on something,</i>

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,160
<i>he prefers using a pen and paper.</i>

228
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,080
<i>We even have to print scripts for him.</i>

229
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
<i>As for my bias, he’s afraid of flying.</i>

230
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,360
<i>He starts panicking</i>
<i>the moment the van leaves.</i>

231
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
Ouch!

232
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,200
<i>He can’t keep his hands still.</i>

233
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,720
<i>He even squeezed</i>
<i>and hurt his friend’s hands.</i>

234
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,600
<i>Nano likes to collect his favorite shoes</i>
<i>in his room at the group’s house,</i>

235
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,520
<i>but there’s still one edition</i>
<i>he couldn’t find and buy.</i>

236
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
So, how is it?
Are you not confused anymore?

237
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Actually, I’m still a bit confused.

238
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,720
Why are you this confused, huh?

239
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,720
Just forget about it.

240
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,400
By the way,
while you were talking about Nano,

241
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
you mentioned the group’s house.

242
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,520
What is it?

243
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
How come you don’t know
what the group’s house is?!

244
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,440
Well, it’s where the members
have been living together since the debut.

245
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,960
I see.

246
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,440
<i>How's your work</i>
<i>on the documentary going, huh?</i>

247
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,040
<i>You don’t even know something</i>
<i>as basic as their house?</i>

248
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Well,

249
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,360
anyway,

250
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,760
I’ll get more information myself.

251
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
- That’s it for now. Bye.
- <i>Hold on.</i>

252
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,520
<i>I have something to ask you, too.</i>

253
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,280
What is it?

254
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,880
You’re Mr. A,

255
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,600
and who’s Mr. B?

256
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
I bet it’s Mick.

257
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Is it him for real?

258
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,960
<i>Actually, I think you should film</i>
<i>some footage there.</i>

259
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,960
<i>I think nobody is living there anymore.</i>

260
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,560
<i>I’ll get a key for you.</i>

261
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>If you get inside the group’s house,</i>

262
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
<i>try searching for an old planner.</i>

263
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,560
<i>Members wrote down</i>
<i>their feelings for each other in it.</i>

264
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,560
<i>I don’t know what they wrote,</i>

265
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
<i>but if you find it,</i>

266
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
<i>I think you can include a lot</i>
<i>of those things in your documentary.</i>

267
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
Let’s continue
the interview from yesterday.

268
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Sure.

269
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,200
Say something to your members, please.

270
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,680
Sure.

271
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
Let me start
with our youngest member, Nano.

272
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,040
Stay cute and lively like this forever.

273
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,440
Eat a lot, so you’ll grow up fast.

274
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,240
Next is Pepper.

275
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,280
I hope you find success
in the MC job you’ve always wanted.

276
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,080
- You’re the best.
- Q: SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR MEMBERS

277
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,560
{\an8}Dylan, you’ll get to write
a lot more songs.

278
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,200
Every song you wrote is amazing.

279
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,600
In the future, I’m sure you’ll become
a really famous producer.

280
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,520
Finally,

281
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
Jun,

282
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,960
your acting career
might be a bit challenging,

283
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,760
but someone determined like you

284
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,120
certainly has
a very promising future ahead.

285
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,000
Was it a tough decision to make
when you decided to go to Korea?

286
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,440
It was.

287
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,000
I had to consider lots of things.

288
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,800
My members and I talked it through,

289
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,160
but they all supported me
to make the decision for myself

290
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,640
because they believe parting ways

291
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,040
to do what we love is the best option.

292
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,160
They’re happy
we’ve come to this final decision.

293
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,320
<i>MARS started with us</i>
<i>supporting one another,</i>

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,680
<i>and even if we’re saying goodbye,</i>

295
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
<i>we’re doing that for each other as well.</i>

296
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
OH THAME! HELLO
JUN FRIED CHICKEN, THAME AND FRIENDS

297
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
<i>Until the last day,</i>

298
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,360
<i>we’re giving one another</i>
<i>meaningful symbolic gifts.</i>

299
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,520
These are birthstones
Thame is going to give his members.

300
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,840
See? Do you think it’s a good idea?

301
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Stop it.

302
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,200
Did I mess up my script?

303
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
That’s because
you followed the script exactly.

304
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,680
That’s why I don’t know
how you actually feel.

305
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,480
So, you're going to keep
nagging me about this, huh?

306
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
For a job like this,

307
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,440
it’s not necessary

308
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,040
to involve our own feelings.

309
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
Can you stop doing things
that aren’t part of your job?

310
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,520
But what you're doing now

311
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
isn’t part of your job either, right?

312
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,320
All day today,

313
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
from watching you,

314
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,640
I noticed you followed everything

315
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
the company instructed you to do
exactly as told.

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,120
Throw it away.

317
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,520
- How have you been, Thame, Ice?
- I’m good.

318
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,880
Have you tasted
our brand’s new flavor snack?

319
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,800
Of course.

320
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
I think your newly launched flavor
is really delicious.

321
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,680
Wow.

322
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,920
That was totally on point.

323
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
He followed the script exactly.

324
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,760
Lucky enough, Thame noticed
the product from another brand on set.

325
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,880
Otherwise,
we’re definitely in big trouble.

326
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,040
THAME

327
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,320
Mr. Bunpoj is super hard to please.

328
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,840
Even a single strand of hair
will bother him.

329
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,640
- Yeah, I think it’s…
- Yeah.

330
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
But Thame knows it well

331
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,480
that no matter what,

332
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,240
he can’t hold any brand’s product
where anyone can see it.

333
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,800
If he does, the company
loses out on the benefits.

334
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,120
Shit.

335
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,000
What’s up?

336
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,000
But except for this…

337
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,800
The item each member really wants.

338
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,160
You want the farewell to be nice
and real once before you leave?

339
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,160
But you know what?

340
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
Doing this

341
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,160
probably hurts them even more.

342
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,920
Why would it hurt them more?

343
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,760
These are not silly stones
they just thoughtlessly bought.

344
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Giving them something
that seems thoughtlessly chosen…

345
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,640
would hurt less.

346
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,800
What do you mean?

347
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,720
It’s because this clearly shows

348
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,360
you’re leaving them
because you really don’t care about them.

349
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
These things…

350
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,160
can’t make those left behind understand

351
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,120
why you have to leave them

352
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,480
while you still care about them.

353
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,600
And in front of the camera,

354
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
they have to force themselves
on everything already.

355
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,480
What kind of face
do you think they can put on?

356
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,800
I just want to do something nice for them.

357
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Why don’t you say
what’s really on your mind

358
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
through this footage

359
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,400
and let me show it to your members?

360
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,520
This is not about me
wanting to understand you,

361
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,640
but it’s because
you told me you feel hurt.

362
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,040
If you want to do
something nice before leaving,

363
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,400
this might be the only way left.

364
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,400
Are you recording it already?

365
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,840
Not yet.

366
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,880
I don’t know what to say.

367
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,080
I don’t know if I should say it, either.

368
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,000
In the end,

369
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,480
if it doesn't turn out okay,

370
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
we can just delete it and record it again.

371
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,520
It’s as simple as this.

372
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,320
Mm-hmm.

373
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Okay?

374
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,120
Camera, speed.

375
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,480
Please say something to your members.

376
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,000
I’m sorry

377
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,320
about everything.

378
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,800
It turned out…

379
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,840
I couldn’t say anything
apart from saying sorry.

380
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,040
How about this?

381
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,960
You talk, and I’ll write it down
as a script.

382
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,120
Then you can follow the script again.

383
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,240
You’re really serious about your work.

384
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Well,

385
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,920
this job is important to me.

386
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,600
That much?

387
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,840
Yeah.

388
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,320
Well, someone once looked down on me,

389
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,520
saying I’m useless and good for nothing.

390
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,320
All I could do was work
part-time at a suit shop

391
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,800
or getting hired by a fanbase account.

392
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,840
So, I want to prove

393
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,240
that I can succeed, too.

394
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,400
Just forget about my story.

395
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,520
Anyway, what do you want to say?

396
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I’ll write it for you.

397
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,880
I don’t think…

398
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,440
I can put it into words,

399
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,520
but I can tell you what I’m sorry for.

400
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,720
I’m sorry.

401
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
I’m sorry, back then, I thought…

402
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,080
Thame,

403
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,960
I’m giving you a solo single

404
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,440
to boost MARS’ popularity.

405
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,680
Here.

406
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,120
Look at this.

407
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,200
Our first album didn’t sell that well.

408
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
Honestly, from a business perspective,

409
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
keeping MARS going has been a loss.

410
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I even thought about shutting it down.

411
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,800
<i>The last image I’ll remember is…</i>

412
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,040
<i>I thought releasing my solo single</i>

413
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,200
<i>would improve the group’s situation.</i>

414
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,440
<i>I thought everything would work out</i>

415
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,920
<i>the way the company promised.</i>

416
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,920
<i>All I need is</i>

417
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,240
<i>You… you… you</i>

418
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,960
<i>You… you… you</i>

419
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,160
A solo contract?

420
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
Just sign it, Thame. Do it for your group.

421
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,560
<i>I thought this income</i>
<i>would strengthen MARS.</i>

422
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
<i>I want us to produce this single for MARS.</i>

423
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,360
- It’s the song that…
- We aren’t going to do it, Thame.

424
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,000
But I fixed the lyrics…

425
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,920
No matter how good it is,

426
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,880
we aren’t producing it under MARS anymore.

427
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,120
Huh?

428
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,520
What do you mean?

429
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,040
Aren’t we making enough profits
for you to keep the group going?

430
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,680
I signed so many endorsement contracts.

431
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
We’re gaining this much popularity.

432
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Isn’t it enough?

433
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
This is not what I mean.

434
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,400
But now, we’ve got a better offer.

435
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,880
A Korean agency
wants you to sign with them.

436
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,680
I’m not going.

437
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,440
I’ve done all these things

438
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,120
because I want to do this with my members.

439
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,880
I understand
you’ve done everything for MARS,

440
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,920
and you’ve kept
pushing forward as the leader.

441
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,160
But I want you to look back

442
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,000
at what happened along the journey.

443
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,040
So, I have to drop my series lineup
just to fit his schedule?

444
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,480
Yes.

445
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Let me be frank with you.

446
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,280
Is MARS now still MARS as a group?

447
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,280
As the leader,

448
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,800
do you think you’re making
the group better or worse?

449
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,800
I’m not saying all this
to make you go to Korea,

450
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,600
but I want you to reconsider

451
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,040
if staying as MARS
is really good to your friends.

452
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
Jun!

453
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
SECRET AGENT 005

454
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,200
<i>Jun really wants to become an actor,</i>

455
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,000
<i>but he can’t sign the contract</i>
<i>because he’s tied to MARS.</i>

456
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,639
<i>Nano wants to get back to studying.</i>

457
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,360
<i>Pepper is now so popular with his MC job</i>

458
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
<i>that he’s always</i>
<i>spending time at the studio.</i>

459
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,679
<i>As for Dylan, you know full well</i>
<i>he doesn't like pop music.</i>

460
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,760
<i>Thame,</i>

461
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,120
<i>I want you to look</i>
<i>around yourself once again…</i>

462
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,480
OH THAME! HELLO
JUN FRIED CHICKEN, THAME AND FRIENDS

463
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,719
<i>…to see if your friends</i>
<i>are now happy or tortured.</i>

464
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,120
I’m sorry for having
been selfish for so long,

465
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,240
keeping my members under the name MARS,

466
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,720
while, in fact,

467
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,040
none of them wants to work
under MARS anymore.

468
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,240
No one has even returned
to the group’s house

469
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,240
we used to live in together.

470
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,320
I’m sorry,

471
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,080
I never looked back.

472
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,840
I’m sorry for being
such a terrible leader.

473
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,920
You agree, don’t you?

474
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
You’re back.

475
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,560
This is Uncle Joei.

476
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,360
Uncle, this is Thame.

477
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

478
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,720
Can you help tidy up the shop for me?

479
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,040
I have to go out and run an errand.

480
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,640
I'm sorry for reaching out
to you so suddenly.

481
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,600
Don’t worry, Uncle. You can leave.

482
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,560
Okay.

483
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,560
Bye-bye.

484
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,720
I’m sorry for dragging you here
and continuing the interview.

485
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,040
It’s all right.

486
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,200
Actually, the company told me
to spend time with my family

487
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,080
before flying to Korea tomorrow,

488
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,200
but my parents aren’t free either.

489
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,280
Do you want some water or anything first?

490
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,480
Your previous job looks nice.

491
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,000
Really?

492
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Who said

493
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,640
it wasn’t good?

494
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
My ex did.

495
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,120
I fixed this suit, you know.

496
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
You’re really dedicated to your work.

497
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,400
Am I?

498
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,720
I can tell what kind of person you are.

499
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,920
Otherwise,

500
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
you wouldn’t be working this hard
on this documentary like you’re doing now.

501
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
Actually,

502
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,440
it’s also because of you.

503
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,240
You said I’m doing my job well.

504
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,480
I see.

505
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,240
Anyway,

506
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,680
thank you for cooperating.

507
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,120
Well,

508
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,000
you said you wanted
to understand me, right?

509
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Did I help you understand me
somewhat better?

510
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,160
Well,

511
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,600
yeah.

512
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,160
We must wrap up the interview.

513
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,720
By the way, while you were talking,

514
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,160
there was one thing I wanted to tell you.

515
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,720
What is it?

516
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
On my last visit,

517
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,360
it seems someone is still going back
to the group’s house.

518
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
<i>The sour orange tree isn’t dead yet.</i>

519
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,840
<i>It even has some fruit.</i>

520
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,640
<i>The house is still clean.</i>

521
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,480
<i>I don’t think it’s Mick’s doing, though.</i>

522
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,440
He doesn’t even do his own tasks.

523
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,840
That’s why I think someone
is still living there.

524
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
Perhaps, it isn’t empty like you thought.

525
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,440
Also,

526
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,120
I don’t know
if I have any right to say this,

527
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,960
but you aren’t a terrible leader at all.

528
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,040
At least you had a goal to benefit others,

529
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,160
and you realized your mistakes,

530
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,240
but it’s a regret

531
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,480
you chose to protect their feelings

532
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,280
by walking away,

533
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,120
not by fixing it.

534
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,120
<i>Which country came up with the idea</i>

535
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,920
<i>of hanging wish messages</i>
<i>on the orange tree?</i>

536
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,760
<i>It’s just from Thailand.</i>

537
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,880
{\an8}<i>It’s cute, isn’t it?</i>

538
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,240
{\an8}<i>- Each member’s promises.</i>
- I'LL CHOREOGRAPH A COOL DANCE,

539
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,480
{\an8}- He wants to do it, so let him.
- SO OUR SONG WILL ALL-KILL - NANO

540
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
See? Even Dylan is cooperating.

541
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,960
Cultural cultivation.

542
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,560
Do you get it?

543
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,560
{\an8}I WILL MAKE MARS ALL-KILL THE CHART
PEPPER

544
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,880
I WILL WRITE THAT SONG

545
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,880
AFTER THE ALL-KILL
LET’S EAT HOT POT INSTANT NOODLES - JUN

546
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,240
Thame,

547
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,800
it’s your turn.

548
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,760
{\an8}I WILL MAKE EVERYONE’S WISHES COME TRUE
THAME

549
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,200
You’ve sent the van
to pick Thame up, right?

550
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
Let him go with the team.

551
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,080
Yes.

552
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,880
He’s definitely coming, Miss Pemika.

553
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,640
Here you are.

554
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,960
Well, I ordered one.

555
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,520
Pardon?

556
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,720
Nothing.

557
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
Eh? Two sandwiches again?

558
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,560
When will the seller
figure out you’re single now?

559
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,680
Come on, Uncle.

560
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,960
It's bad enough I have
to spend money on two sandwiches.

561
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,120
Now, you're bringing up
that I'm single again.

562
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,440
I’m wrong again, huh?

563
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,320
Why don’t you just talk to him directly?

564
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,560
Tell him your partner passed away.

565
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,840
I don’t need a reminder.

566
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
I know the alumni gathering is at 9 p.m.

567
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,000
I’m not talking about that.

568
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,040
I just want to know who Mr. B is.

569
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,360
I told you, it’s hypothetical.

570
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,360
<i>I don’t believe you.</i>

571
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,600
I bet you’ve got someone new
sharing sandwiches with you.

572
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,520
Am I right?

573
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,880
No!

574
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,400
I don’t have anyone
sharing sandwiches with me.

575
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,320
I’ll hang up!

576
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,240
Why are you here?

577
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,680
How about your Korea trip?

578
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,640
Oh, there he is.

579
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,760
Sir, where is Thame?

580
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,320
I’ve got an answer for you.

581
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,320
Are you crazy?

582
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,200
Why are you telling me now
when to send clips to your members?

583
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,240
You’re supposed
to be boarding your flight.

584
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,360
So, this is my answer.

585
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,240
Huh?

586
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,560
I want to tell them in person.

587
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,800
How about your Korea trip?

588
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,800
I’m not going anymore.

589
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Huh?

590
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,680
Someone is still going back
to the MARS house.

591
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,800
{\an8}I WILL MAKE EVERYONE’S WISHES COME TRUE
THAME

592
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,240
I might have been wrong,

593
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,760
thinking MARS was dead.

594
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,040
Maybe it’s just waiting for a rebirth.

595
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,560
I just have to fix it, like you said.

596
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,200
- But…
- Can you help reunite us as a group?

597
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,760
Whether you can or can’t,

598
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,880
give me a sign.

599
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,360
When I walked in,

600
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,760
you were about
to throw that sandwich away.

601
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
If you’re not okay with this,

602
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,120
just throw it away,
like you were about to.

603
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,880
But if you’re okay to help,

604
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,960
can you give me that sandwich?

605
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,560
What the hell
is damn wrong with you, Thame?!

606
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,480
Hey.

607
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,080
- Jun, what are you doing?!
- What the hell?

608
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,360
Stop doing something insane
and go back to Korea already.

609
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,400
You’re in trouble because of me, right?

610
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,400
It’s I who put you in trouble.

611
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,080
How about convincing
other members to join us first?

612
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,760
It might be easier
to pressure Jun that way.

613
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,480
No matter what, Jun must be the first one.

614
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,640
<i>To make the plan successful,</i>

615
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,360
<i>Jun really must be the first one</i>

616
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,320
because he’s the one
I believe in and trust.

617
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,560
I think Thame isn’t someone
who would plan and do something alone.

618
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,400
Do you want me to find out who’s helping?
